Simulations of non-equilibrium charge transport in a one-dimensional wire with temperature gradient.

The Fortran code "linearchain.f90" calculates the nonequilibrium electron transport through a chain of N sites, each one coupled to a phonon bath. We assume that each bath has a different temperature, leading to a temperature gradient in the system. In addition, disorder in the chain is modelled by an Anderson Hamiltonian. The lattice is tunnel coupled to two leads.
